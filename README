##### Purpose
purpose of this project was to familiarize myself with javascript and html. 
The initial idea is for a blueprint segmenting app for security at venues to properly check each room depending on risks/manpower.
In the future I want to test out image processing software to automatically accomplish this but the initial task was get more used to javascript and html.


##### Future fixes/plans
- fix selection list to track currently selected polygon
- add color variants to polygons
- add save and load feature to image/polygons
- style all elements

##### Problems
- when pushing to github a file in history was too large, i had to create an new branch with no history to push it. all commits and branches are local.
